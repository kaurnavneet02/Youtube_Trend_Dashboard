# Youtube_Trend_Dashboard
We developed a dashboard with interactive plots that allow us to observe YouTube video trends over the past ten years.

We have created an interactive and dynamic dashboard using the flexdashboard library in RStudio. This dashboard is specifically designed to analyze the latest trends on YouTube, providing valuable insights to content creators who aim to boost their viewership. To enhance the visual appeal and interactivity, we have incorporated libraries such as ggplot and plotly, which enable the creation of captivating graphs and charts. With this project, content creators can easily identify lucrative areas for increasing their viewership on YouTube.
